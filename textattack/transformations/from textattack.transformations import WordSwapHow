The more open the club face is at impact, the more sidespin the ball will have. The swing path determines the starting point of the slice. The more a golfer swings from outside-in, the more the ball will start left of the target before slicing right. A pull slice is caused by a severe outside-to-in swing path. A push slice is caused by an inside-to-out swing path with an open club face.'))
